            <td><b>Shounen</b></td>
            <td>Literally means “few years” when translated in English, and typically refers to young boys in their adolescent years. A lot of shounen anime have at least one young male as a hero. However, there are also contemporary shounen anime with female protagonists who are often beautiful.</td>

          <tr>
            <td><b>Seinen</b></td>
            <td>It means “young man or men” in English, and it is not indicative of sexual content. Seinen anime target adult male viewers and have the same story lines as shounen anime, although the plot is usually more violent and/or psychological in nature.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>Shoujo</b></td>
            <td>It is translated as “young girl” and is the counterpart of shounen. Shoujo anime target adolescent female viewers and the main story usually focuses on interpersonal relationships and romance. Shoujo anime tend to be dramatic, but there are also some that include shounen anime elements like action, adventure, and comedy.</td>
          <tr>
            <td><b>Josei</b></td>
            <td>This means “woman” when translated in English. In anime or manga, it is the counterpart of seinen. Josei anime target adult female viewers and the main story usually tackles romance with a more realistic feel to it than shoujo anime.</td>
