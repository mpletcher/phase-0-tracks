##Write the algorithm for using an elevator
###Simple steps

1. Walk to the nearest elevator.
2. When you find an elevator, stop in front of it. Otherwise, keep walking until you find an elevator.
(Equipped with special sensors, his vision can scan and identify movement, IEC / ISO symbols, letters, numbers, or the Standard Tactile Symbol System)
3. Scan all the elevator panel control symbols
4. Compare each symbol with its respective button
5. When you identify all default buttons, move your hand toward the elevator panel control
6. Push the Open Door button 
7. Gently, move your hand back toward yourself
8. Scan the elevator door, if the door is open, walk into the elevator. Otherwise, re-scan its control panel, re-press the Open Door button
9. Repeat these instructions until you can walk into the elevator.
10. Scan the interior of the elevator, if you find any humans or other robots, say "Hello!"
11. If you hear "Hi" or "Hello" or "Hey", smile. Otherwise, keep quite
12. Scan the elevator door and its interior panel control
13. If the elevator door is open, move your hand toward the elevator panel control
14. Push the Close Door button. 
15. Scan the elevator door, if door is open, repeat these instructions until it can be closed
16. Memorize what floor you are by storing this value in a variable called currentFloor
17. Select the particular floor you need to go and push its button
18. Gently, move your hand back toward yourself
19. When the elevator changes floor, scan its panel control 
20. If the number of the current floor is greater than currentFloor, add 1 to currentFloor.
21. If the number of the current floor is less than currentFloor, remove 1 to currentFloor. Otherwise, do nothing.
22. When the currentFloor value is your selected floor, scan the elevator door, if the door is open, walk out of the elevator. Otherwise, re-scan its control panel, re-press the Open Door button
23. Repeat these instructions until you can walk out of the elevator.


## Simple Drip Irrigation System
## Steps
1. Daily at 6 pm, the Pressure Gauge installed in the garden begins to pump water from the water source.
2. Water is pumped through the main pipe installed in the water source.
3. When the water arrives at the Sand Separator Hydrocyclone filter, a conical shaped separator accelerates the velocity of water maximizing separation of sand and other solid components.
4. On average, 60 to 80% of sand and other solid components must be separated from the water.
5. If sand and other components are found, sand and other solid components are stored in the collection filter. 
6. Until water does not reach these aforementioned levels of purity, water continues to be filtered. Otherwise, water is released from the inside of the filter.
7. Clean water continues to be pumped through a series of interconnected pipes in the garden.
Water is released through holes in each water pipe
8. Plants are irrigated.
