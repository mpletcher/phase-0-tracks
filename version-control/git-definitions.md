# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

*It is a software that keeps track of each modification in the code of a program. If an error occurs, this version control system allows developers to roll back and review any previously submitted code of programs.
*

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

*Basically, it is a copy that allows users to branch off their code from a master branch. In other words, a copy of our code is created allowing us to safely work in our code without making mistakes in our master project.*

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

*Commit is a command line that saves changes in a repo. Commits are similar to snapshots of our code. Additionally, a good message must concisely describe what changes were made with accuracy.*

* What is a merge conflict?

*Basically, a merge conflict happens when users change the same part of a file on different branches or delete files. Therefore, the system control does not know what is correct.*
