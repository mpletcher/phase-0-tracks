## Release 2: View a Many‐to‐Many Relationship
1. In the welp directory, create a file called queries.txt . Once you've figured out the queries below, paste them into queries.txt , along with the output from your database.

```
touch queries.txt
```

2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

```
SELECT * FROM reviews JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;
```

(PK1) Rev| Star | Comment | (FK) users| (FK) business | (PK1) Users | First Name | Last Name | (PK1) Biz | Biz Name

7|5|Stellar service|7|7|7|Denzel|George|7|JoeBob's Sport Barn


3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

```
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;
```

First Name| Last Name | Biz Name | Star | Comment

4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

```
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id WHERE business_id = 6;

```
