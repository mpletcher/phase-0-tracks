## Release 0: Build Your Tables


1. Create a folder for this project in phase-0-tracks/databases called welp .

```
mkdir welp
```


2. In the welp directory, create a database called welp.db .

```
sqlite3 welp.db
```


3. Create the businesses table. Make sure to use a primary key.

```
CREATE TABLE businesses (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255)
);
```

4. Create the users table. Make sure to use a primary key.

```
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(255),
    last_name VARCHAR(255)
);
```

*This table is often called a junction table or join table, which is a simple table that connects users to businesses. It has two foreign keys; optionally, it could also have a primary key. Notice the name of the table: businesses_users . It's a convention to name simple junction tables this way, with the two table names arranged in alphabetical order and separated by an underscore.*

```
CREATE TABLE businesses_users (
    business_id INT,
    user_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY(business_id) REFERENCES businesses(id),
    FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(id) 
);
```


5. Populate each table with a few items.

```
INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name) VALUES ("Bradford", "Pitt");
INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name) VALUES ("Mandy", "Kaling");
INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name) VALUES ("Angela", "Jolie");
INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name) VALUES ("Steven", "Wonder");
INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name) VALUES ("Holly", "Berry");
INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name) VALUES ("Merryl", "Streep");
INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name) VALUES ("Denzel", "George");
```

```
INSERT INTO businesses (name) VALUES ("Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel");
INSERT INTO businesses (name) VALUES ("Amir's Towing");
INSERT INTO businesses (name) VALUES ("The Beagle Nightclub");
INSERT INTO businesses (name) VALUES ("Lotus Yoga");
INSERT INTO businesses (name) VALUES ("Plumbing by Janet");
INSERT INTO businesses (name) VALUES ("Sushi World");
INSERT INTO businesses (name) VALUES ("JoeBob's Sport Barn");
```

```
INSERT INTO businesses_users (user_id, business_id) VALUES (1,1);
INSERT INTO businesses_users (user_id, business_id) VALUES (2,2);
INSERT INTO businesses_users (user_id, business_id) VALUES (3,3);
INSERT INTO businesses_users (user_id, business_id) VALUES (4,6);
INSERT INTO businesses_users (user_id, business_id) VALUES (5,4);
INSERT INTO businesses_users (user_id, business_id) VALUES (6,5);
INSERT INTO businesses_users (user_id, business_id) VALUES (7,7);
```


## Release 1: Connect the Tables
1. Build the reviews table depicted in the second schema. When you create the table, you'll need to declare two foreign keys and a primary key, along with any data needed for the review.

```
DROP TABLE businesses_users;
```
```
CREATE TABLE reviews (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    stars INT,
    comment VARCHAR(255),
    business_id INT,
    user_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY(business_id) REFERENCES businesses(id),
    FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(id) 
);
```

2. Populate your reviews table with a few pieces of data. You'll need to provide valid integers for both of the foreign keys (one valid id of a user, and one valid id of a business). An example review might consist of 5 stars, the text "great food!", a business ID of 1, and a user ID of 1 (provided you have a business with a primary key of 1 and a user with a primary key of 1).

```
INSERT INTO reviews (stars, comment, user_id, business_id) VALUES (5,"Stellar service", 1, 1);
INSERT INTO reviews (stars, comment, user_id, business_id) VALUES (4,"Good service", 2, 2);
INSERT INTO reviews (stars, comment, user_id, business_id) VALUES (3,"Not bad service", 3, 3);
INSERT INTO reviews (stars, comment, user_id, business_id) VALUES (2,"Don't go back", 3, 4);
INSERT INTO reviews (stars, comment, user_id, business_id) VALUES (5,"Stellar service", 5, 5);
INSERT INTO reviews (stars, comment, user_id, business_id) VALUES (4,"Good service", 6, 6);
INSERT INTO reviews (stars, comment, user_id, business_id) VALUES (5,"Stellar service", 7, 7);
```


## Release 2: View a Many‐to‐Many Relationship
1. In the welp directory, create a file called queries.txt . Once you've figured out the queries below, paste them into queries.txt , along with the output from your database.

```
touch readme.md queries.txt
```

2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

```
SELECT * FROM reviews JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;
```

(PK1) Rev| Star | Comment | (FK) users| (FK) business | (PK1) Users | First Name | Last Name | (PK1) Biz | Biz Name 
------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------- | ------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------:
1|5|Stellar service|1|1|1|Bradford|Pitt|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel
2|4|Good service|2|2|2|Mandy|Kaling|2|Amir's Towing
3|3|Not bad service|3|3|3|Angela|Jolie|3|The Beagle Nightclub
4|2|Don't go back|4|3|3|Angela|Jolie|4|Lotus Yoga
5|5|Stellar service|5|5|5|Holly|Berry|5|Plumbing by Janet
6|4|Good service|6|6|6|Merryl|Streep|6|Sushi World
7|5|Stellar service|7|7|7|Denzel|George|7|JoeBob's Sport Barn


3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

```
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;
```

First Name| Last Name | Biz Name | Star | Comment
--------- | ------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------:
Bradford|Pitt|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|5|Stellar service
Mandy|Kaling|Amir's Towing|4|Good service
Angela|Jolie|The Beagle Nightclub|3|Not bad service
Angela|Jolie|Lotus Yoga|2|Don't go back
Holly|Berry|Plumbing by Janet|5|Stellar service
Merryl|Streep|Sushi World|4|Good service
Denzel|George|JoeBob's Sport Barn|5|Stellar service


4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

```
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id WHERE business_id = 6;

```

First Name| Last Name | Biz Name | Star | Comment
--------- | ------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------:
Merryl|Streep|Sushi World|4|Good service
