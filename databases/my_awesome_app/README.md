## Release 0-3: Build Something Awesome

Write a Ruby program that uses persistent data to make your life better, or makes someone else's life better. Find several opportunities to try something not explicitly shown in the video. Can users create data? Retrieve it? Manipulate it? It's up to you. 

Push yourself, and decide with integrity when you are finished. Note that you do not need to use classes in this assignment -- keeping a class instance and a database row in sync is a lot of work, so that might be too much to tackle.
