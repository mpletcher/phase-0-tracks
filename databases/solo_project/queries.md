## Release 0: Design a Schema

1. In phase-0-tracks/databases, create a new directory called solo_project.
```
mkdir solo_project
```

2. Come up with an idea for two database tables that would have a one-to-many relationship. (Don't use any of the examples we've already given.) On paper, a whiteboard, a tablet, or whatever else is comfortable, draw out the schema. In addition to the required primary and foreign keys, your tables should use three data types (you can use the ones we've learned so far, or try something different if you'd like).


3. Think about naming conventions and general readability, and make sure that your database, table, and column names make sense.
4. Save a screenshot or other photo of your schema drawing in the solo_project directory.

## Release 1: Build Your Database
1. In the solo_project directory, create your database and your two tables.
2. Populate both tables with enough data to make queries interesting (a few items per table at least).


## Release 2: Execute SQL Queries
In the solo_project directory, create a file called queries.txt. For each SQL query you run, paste both the command and the output (if any) into queries.txt.
```
touch queries.txt queries.md
```
Run a SQL query for each of the following:

1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
3. Display the information in both tables using one query.
4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).


## Release 3: Research on Your Own
1. There are lots of different kinds of joins. What are they? Can you apply different conditions to a join to change what's displayed? Can you bookmark any good diagrams that will help you tell different joins apart in the future?
2. Try a few different joins in your database, and record the commands and the output in queries.txt.
