## jQuery


### My plan
1. Open my eBook JS & jQuery the missing manual
2. Read Introduction to jQuery
3. Verify my previous Google Docs Notes regarding 
4. Take a look at small project and assignments 
5. Watch YouTube Tutorials

### My Script Notes
* jQuery is so intimately tied into CSS.
* Basically, jQuery is a JavaScript library.
* jQuery makes JavaScript program easier and faster by automatic looping and chaining.
* The $(document).ready() function is a built-in jQuery function that waits until the HTML for a page loads before it runs your script. In other words, in order to do cool stuff to the HTML on your page, we need to wait until the page loads. That’s what the $(document).ready() function does: It simply waits until the HTML is finished loading and then it runs the JavaScript code."

```
// A $( document ).ready() block.
$( document ).ready(function() {
    console.log( "ready!" );
});
```

* Events are also good stuff. They are used to add interactivity to a web page, such as hover(), .mouseenter(), etcetera 


* The DOM's interaction on a page with JavaScript and jQuery now make much more sense. The DOM plays a critical role in allowing JavaScript to communicate with the different elements on the page to change the HTML elements on the page. Note some of the short-comings with the DOM methods and you’ll begin to why jQuery was designed to address some of those issues (i.e cross-browser compatibility).

### Conclusion

jQuery is so big and its capabilities are amazing. I would suggest beginners start testing simple elements and try to understand them on their browser's console.
