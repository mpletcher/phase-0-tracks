### Release 0: Make a Plan

* PLAN THE THING (10 MINUTES MAX)

Create a Markdown file called notes.md in phase-0-tracks/web_dev/jquery (you'll have to create the directory as well). Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.

### Release 1: Study Up
* LEARN THE THING (2 HOURS MAX)

Time to execute your plan. Aaaand ... go! When the time is up, record in notes.md which strategies seemed to be the most effective.

### Release 2: Make a Thing
* DO THE THING (45 MINUTES MAX)

Make a jQuery project and add it to the jquery directory. It can be tiny, and it can do whatever you like, as long as you can say in good faith that you're practicing what you've learned and improving your jQuery skills.
